Date: 02/17/2023

Start of the day: 8am - 9am

found some videos on Parallax scrolling here is the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxHoPYFsTuk. Ive been watching this and doing research on my other computer. Still re-watching the videos.

9am - 10am

found this video on Js animations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUzihD4JBQU been watching that and googling CSS animations as well for my portfolio capstone.

10am - 11am

Was looking for a javaScript library to import and finally found one i liked. its called Particles and heres the link to the video and Github https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUzihD4JBQU || https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/ for the JS library.

11am - 12pm

I was in the process of trying to importing the Js Particle library into my project. Ive ran into some issues trying to get it running. its a WIP.

1pm - 2pm

Im still currently trying to get this particle.js library to work. its giving me trouble trying to get it to work. This will he my starting point once i can get this to work. WIP.

2pm - 3pm

Im still currently trying to get the library to work with my project. Ive changed gears though. im going to start a new project without webpack, package.json and all the other packages im not going to need. Starting a New repo now at https://github.com/BrandonF55/Portfolio-Capstone-.git. I had a total of 8 commits before making a new repo. I have a detailed research page to show my work from this point.

3pm - 4pm

Ive started a new repo and im running into a issues getting it up and running. I found this video with a different technique. here is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELV32bqMBlc. Im hoping this video has the solution on how to get this working.

4pm - 5pm

the last hour of the day i was trying to get the library to work. There are tons of videos on Particle.js, and how to make it work but i cant seem to get it going. I think im going to research to library's to us in my project.
